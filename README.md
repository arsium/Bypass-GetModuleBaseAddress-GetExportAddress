# Bypass-GetModuleBaseAddress-GetExportAddress in C#
A proof of concept of real and native custom GetProcAddress and GetModuleBaseAddress in C#.

This took me so long time to code it and finding resources about it (mostly old and not working anymore or C++).

I decided to write that in C# because I've never seen REAL implementation of that and I learnt so many things about low-level with windows from my own errors and test to other's code.
